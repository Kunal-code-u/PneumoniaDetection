# PneumoniaDetection
This is pnuemonia detection project using CNN(Deep Learning)
Introduction
This project develops a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for automated pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images. It aims to assist healthcare providers with a reliable, efficient diagnostic tool, minimizing the time and subjectivity of manual analysis.

Purpose:
Detect pneumonia accurately to improve patient outcomes and support clinical workflows.

Significance:

Pneumonia is a critical global health concern requiring timely diagnosis.
CNNs enable consistent and efficient processing of medical images, reducing diagnostic errors and radiologist workload.
Literature Review
Key Study: CheXNet by Rajpurkar et al. demonstrated high accuracy in pneumonia detection, setting a benchmark for CNN-based diagnostics.
Challenges:
Limited generalizability across populations and imaging conditions.
Imbalanced datasets often favor normal cases, requiring augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, and zooming to enhance learning.
Methodology
Dataset and Preprocessing:

Labeled chest X-ray images for pneumonia-positive and negative cases.
Preprocessing includes normalization and data augmentation for diversity and robustness.
Model Architecture:

Layers: Convolutional (feature extraction), pooling (dimensionality reduction), and fully connected (classification).
Activation: ReLU for hidden layers; softmax for output.
Training Parameters: Learning rate = 0.00001, batch size = 32, epochs = 12.
Results
Performance Metrics:
Accuracy: 91.99%
Precision: 92%
Recall: 92%
F1-score: 92%
Conclusion
The project demonstrates the feasibility of CNNs in medical diagnostics, highlighting their potential to:

Reduce diagnostic time and radiologist workload.
Improve patient outcomes through early detection.
Recommendations:

Integrate the model in clinical workflows as a supplementary tool.
Regularly update the model with diverse datasets for generalizability.
Add visualization tools like heatmaps to enhance interpretability.
